# Unit-02-CSS-Bootstrap
With this project you will find my original html and css code copied over from homework-01. I left in a lot of the old (obsolete) code by just commenting it out. Hopefully it illustrates my thought process on what needed to go. 

Alot of those removals were required due to the code conflicting, or being redundant with the new bootstrap code that was brought over for the navbar and responsive images. 

Using the template provided I matched the screenshots as best as I could at the different pixel widths. Unfortunately, the bootstrap navbar would not allow me to customize it. After spending hours trying to get my css code to work to get the navbar to meet criteria I've simply given up. 

The bootstrap navbar would not allow me to re-align the the nameplate nor the list items. 

Outside of the glaring navbar issues, with the use of only two media queries I believe I have met the criteria at the 3 listed pixel widths 
(excluding the navbar)
